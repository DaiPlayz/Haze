Haze is a high-performance Roblox script built by **ScriptIsFocus**. It’s designed for users who want stability and advanced functionality.

Because Haze relies on higher-level exploit features, it **will not work** on executors that lack certain functions (such as `getrawmetatable`). Executors like **Xeno** and **Solara** are currently unsupported. Most other modern executors should work without issues.

If you run into bugs, crashes, or unexpected behavior, please report them so we can improve the script.

## Loadstring

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Smoker/Haze/refs/heads/main/installer.lua"))()
